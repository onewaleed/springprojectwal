Spring Project - The Trainer Database. 

This project brief was to create a CRUD application that used all of the modules covered in training. I decided to create a system that allowed a user to add trainers to a database. This could be used by a collector to show his collection of trainers. 

Planning Resources; 
I used Jira, to create a Kanban board, I then created Epics and user stories. From the user stories, I created child issues that need to be worked on. I also added back end and front end epics so they were easy to break down.

Git Hub was used, I set up and used three branches. Including a dev branch. 

Live Studio, to see changes in real-time.

Visual Studio Code - HTML was used for the front end. 

JUnit was used for testing. 

Eclipse IDE and SpringBoot was used to code the backend. 

Postman was used to test, the Post and Get functions on the local host.
